# Running Project

## Dev Server
Run the project locally with `npm run dev`

## Build for production
Build static files with `npm run build`

## Preview production build
You can use whatever you want for serving static files, but
by default the script `npm run preview` runs `npx http-server dist`. 
You'll have to have Node's http-server installed for this to work.
